1) Tell us about the world as you see it. (A description of the status
   quo and context in which you will be working, 1500 char)

Thousands of grassroots "learn to code" groups have sprung up in the
last ten years to teach people how to program own.  To be successful,
these groups need a trio of skills: technology, teaching, and
community organization.  However, while most of these groups' founders
have technical backgrounds, they are often self-taught when it comes
to pedagogy, allyship, and non-profit management.

2) What change do you want to make in the world? (A description of
   what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your
   personal vision for this area, 1500 char)

I want to to help people involved in grassroots coding groups that aim
to improve diversity in computing to learn, share, and improve their
teaching practices and community organization skills.

3) What do you believe has prevented this change to date?  (Describe
   the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the
   fellowship year, 1500 char)

1. Most people are unaware of how much we actually know about teaching
   and learning: if you ask the average programmer or professor what
   peer instruction is, or about the cognitive differences between
   novices and competent practitioners, you will probably get a blank
   stare.

2. People with technical backgrounds often don't have any previous
   experience in activism or community organization.  As a result, "We
   can teach them to program" is very rarely matched by the
   realization that, "They can teach us how to run a non-profit and
   make friends at City Hall."

4) What are you going to do to get there?  (A description of what you
   actually plan to do during the year, 1500 char)

I have spent the last six years building a volunteer organization
called Software Carpentry whose members now teach several hundred
two-day coding workshops each year.  Separately, I co-organized a
gathering in 2015 for leaders of grassroots groups trying to increase
diversity in computing.  I believe I can combine what I have learned
from these projects to effect significant change.

1. Guided by community leaders, I will adapt and expand Software
   Carpentry's instructor training course to place much more emphasis
   on teaching disadvantaged and under-represented groups, and include
   material on allyship, community organization, and non-profit
   management.  Everything will be made freely available under a CC-BY
   license.

2. I will teach and co-teach workshops using this material, both in
   person and online, for people with technical backgrounds who wish
   to become involved in grassroots get-into-coding efforts.  I will
   then recruit people who have participated in these workshops to
   become future instructors themselves.

5) What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face? (1500 char)

1. Grassroots coding organizations that focus on under-represented
   groups are often shoestring operations.  Many will not be able to
   bring in an instructor or cover travel costs for people to attend
   workshops.  I will therefore do training online where necessary,
   but will also seek funding from other organizations to subsidize
   travel costs.

2. I am a straight, white, middle-class male with no physical
   disabilities or criminal record: in short, I'm about as privileged
   as it gets.  In order for this project to succeed, I will have to
   recruit a diverse group of collaborators and give them real power
   over the content and direction of this project.

6) What part does openness play in your idea? (1500 char)

1. Software Carpentry's lessons have had contributions from several
   hundred people over four years, primarily because it adapted open
   source software development practices for lesson creation.  That
   experience has convinced me that "open" is the key to creating a
   commons comprised of teaching materials and a community that
   will maintain them.

2. "Open" is meaningless if people do not have the skills and
   opportunities to take advantage of what is supposedly available.
   Helping grassroots coding groups be more effective will enable them
   to bring "open" within reach of more people, particularly those who
   are now notably absent from Silicon Valley.

7) Does your idea/project have a name?
[x] Yes
[ ] No

Teaching Tech Together (the name of the 2015 summit I co-organized)

8) Have you started implementation of the idea?
[x] Yes
[ ] No

Work to date includes creation of Software Carpentry's instructor
training course, the original T3 summit, and lots of practice
organizing and running workshops.

9) How have you funded your initiative in the past?
[ ] Self funded
[ ] Family and friends
[ ] Not funded yet
[ ] Angel investor
[ ] Venture capital
[x] Other

A mix of grants, donations, and partnership fees from various research
organizations.

10) Who are your current or potential key partners?

1. Organizations that have funded diversity initiatives I've been
   involved in previously, including Microsoft, GitHub, Rackspace, JP
   Morgan, Google, and the Python Software Foundation.

2. Existing grassroots coding organizations such as Railsbridge,
   PyLadies, Black Girls Code, and Hear Me Code.

3. Groups such as the Highlander Research and Education Center, the
   Midwest Academy, the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, and others with
   proven track records of teaching community organization and
   leadership.

11) Do you intend to implement the idea as a for profit or not for profit initiative?
[ ] For profit
[x] Not for profit
[ ] Haven't thought about it...

12) Where will you be based during the fellowship?
Base Country: Canada
Base City: Toronto

13) Where will you implement your idea?
[ ] Same as above
[x] Online
[ ] Other country or city

14) Do you have an online presence?
[x] Yes
[ ] No

15) Does the idea/project have an online presence?
[x] Yes
[ ] No
