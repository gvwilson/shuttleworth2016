1) Tell us about the world as you see it. (A description of the status
   quo and context in which you will be working)

Thousands of grassroots "learn to code" groups have sprung up in the
last ten years to teach people how to program own.  To be successful,
these groups need a trio of skills: technology, teaching, and
community organization.  However, most of these groups' founders have
technical backgrounds, and are often now struggling to learn pedagogy,
non-profit management, and allyship on their own.

2) What change do you want to make in the world? (A description of
   what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your
   personal vision for this area)

I want to to help grassroots coding groups --- particularly those
trying to improve diversity in computing --- to share and improve
their curriculum and teaching practices.  At the same time, I want to
introduce programmers to the community organization skills and
perspectives that social justice movements have been honing for
decades.

I have spent the last six years helping to build a volunteer
organization called Software Carpentry whose members now teach several
hundred two-day coding workshops each year.  Separately, I
co-organized a gathering in 2015 called "Teaching Tech Together" (T3)
for leaders of groups trying to increase inclusion of people from
under-represented intersections of gender, race, sexuality, ability,
and class.  I believe I can combine what I have learned from these
projects to effect significant change.

3) What do you believe has prevented this change to date?  (Describe
   the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the
   fellowship year)

1. Most people are unaware of how much we actually know about teaching
   and learning: if you ask the average programmer (or professor) what
   peer instruction is, or what the difference is between formative
   and summative assessment, you will probably get a blank stare.

2. Despite their good intentions, people with technical backgrounds
   usually don't have any previous experience in activism or community
   organization.  As a result, "We can teach them to program" is very
   rarely matched by, "And they can teach us how to run a non-profit
   and make friends at City Hall."

4) What are you going to do to get there?  (A description of what you
   actually plan to do during the year)

1. Since 2012, I have been the principal developer of Software
   Carpentry's intensive two-day introduction to modern teaching
   practices.  Guided by community leaders, I will adapt and expand
   this material to place much more emphasis on teaching disadvantaged
   and under-represented groups, and include material on allyship,
   community organization, and non-profit management.  Everything will
   be made freely available under a CC-BY license.

2. I will teach and co-teach workshops using this material, both in
   person and online, for people with technical backgrounds who wish
   to become involved in grassroots get-into-coding efforts.  I will
   then recruit people who have participated in these workshops (both
   as learners and as co-instructors) to become future instructors,
   using the same learn-help-teach-train model that has enabled
   Software Carpentry to grow.

Work will initially focus on Canada and the United States: you have to
start somewhere, and that's where I am.  If this work is successful, I
will expand it geographically using the same "local champions" model
as Software Carpentry.

5) What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?

1. Grassroots coding organizations that focus on under-represented
   groups are often shoestring operations.  Many will not be able to
   (for example) bring in an instructor or cover travel costs for
   people to attend workshops.  We will therefore seek funding from
   other organizations to subsidize travel costs.  Software Carpentry
   has had good luck finding such money in the past for events such as
   its workshops for women in science and engineering, so I am
   confident we will be able to find what we need.

   Where necessary, we will also do some or all of the training
   online.  However, we recognize that this provides many fewer
   opportunities for participants to make personal connections, which
   I believe will be crucial to the success of this project.

2. I am white, male, straight, and have no physical disabilities or
   criminal record: in short, I'm about as privileged as it gets.  In
   order for this project to succeed, I will have to recruit a diverse
   group of collaborators, and give them real power over the content
   and direction of this project.  I believe I can do this using
   contacts made through the T3 summit, Software Carpentry, and other
   groups.

6) What part does openness play in your idea?

1. Software Carpentry's lessons have had contributions from several
   hundred people over four years, primarily because it adopted and
   adapted open source software development practices.  That
   experience has convinced me that "open" is the key to creating a
   commons comprised of teaching materials and a community that
   maintains them.

2. "Open" is meaningless if people do not have the skills and
   opportunities to take advantage of what is supposedly available.
   Helping grassroots coding groups be more effective will enable them
   to bring "open" within reach of more people, particularly those who
   are now notably absent from Silicon Valley.

7) Does your idea/project have a name?
[x] Yes
[ ] No

Teaching Tech Together (the name of the 2015 summit)

8) Have you started implementation of the idea?
[x] Yes
[ ] No

Work to date includes creation of Software Carpentry's instructor
training course, the original T3 summit, and *lots* of practice
organizing and running workshops.

9) How have you funded your initiative in the past?
[ ] Self funded
[ ] Family and friends
[ ] Not funded yet
[ ] Angel investor
[ ] Venture capital
[x] Other

A mix of grants, donations, and partnership fees from various research organizations.

10) Who are your current or potential key partners?

1. Organizations that have funded diversity initiatives I've been
   involved in previously, including Microsoft, GitHub, Rackspace, JP
   Morgan, Google, and the Python Software Foundation.

2. Existing grassroots coding organizations such as Railsbridge, Black
   Girls Code, DjangoGirls, Ladies Learning Code, and Hear Me Code.

3. Groups such as the Highlander Research and Education Center, the
   Midwest Academy, the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, and others with
   proven track records of teaching community organization and
   leadership.

11) Do you intend to implement the idea as a for profit or not for profit initiative?
[ ] For profit
[x] Not for profit
[ ] Haven't thought about it...
