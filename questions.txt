1) Tell us about the world as you see it. (A description of the status
   quo and context in which you will be working)

Thousands of volunteer "learn to code" groups have sprung up in the
last ten years.  They exist so that people won't have to teach
themselves how to program, but ironically, many of their founders are
teaching themselves everything from instructional design to community
organization.  Like many self-taught programmers, the leaders of these
groups often don't even know what they don't know.

2) What change do you want to make in the world? (A description of
   what you want to change about the status quo, in the world, your
   personal vision for this area)

Over the past six years, I helped build a volunteer non-profit
organization called Software Carpentry that now has over 750 members,
who together teach several hundred two-day workshops to scientists
each year.  Separately, I co-organized a two-day meeting in 2015
called "Teaching Tech Together" (T3) for leaders of grassroots coding
groups that focus on increasing the inclusion of people from
under-represented intersections of gender, race, sexuality, ability,
and class.

I now want to create an organization like Software Carpentry to help
grassroots get-into-coding groups --- particularly those seeking to
correct the computing industry's many diversity failures --- share and
improve curriculum, good teaching practices, and other resources.
More importantly, I want this organization to help programmers learn
the outlook and skills that social justice movements have been honing
for decades.

3) What do you believe has prevented this change to date?  (Describe
   the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the
   fellowship year)

1. Most people are completely unaware of the existence of the
   literature on evidence-based teaching and learning.  Ask the
   average programmer (or professor) what peer instruction is, or what
   the difference is between formative and summative assessment, and
   you will probably get a blank stare.

2. Hubris.  Good intentions aside, people with technical skills
   usually don't have any previous experience in activism, social
   justice, or community organization.  As a result, "We can teach
   them to program" is very rarely matched by, "And they can teach us
   how to run a non-profit, make friends at City Hall, or improve our
   teaching practices."

4) What are you going to do to get there?  (A description of what you
   actually plan to do during the year)

1. Since 2012, I have been the principal developer of Software
   Carpentry's intensive two-day introduction to modern teaching
   practices.  I will adapt and expand this material to place much
   more emphasis on teaching disadvantaged and under-represented
   groups, and to include material on allyship, community
   organization, and non-profit management.  Everything will be made
   freely available under a CC-BY license.

2. I will teach and co-teach workshops using this material, both in
   person and online, for people with technical backgrounds who wish
   to become involved in grassroots get-into-coding efforts.  I will
   then recruit peopple who have participated in these workshops (both
   as learners and as co-instructors) to become future instructors,
   using the same learn-help-teach-train model that has enabled
   Software Carpentry to grow.

Note that work in the first year will focus on Canada and the United
States --- you gotta start somewhere, and that's where I am.  If this
project is successful, I will seek to expand it geographically using
the same "local champions" model as Software Carpentry.

5) What challenges or uncertainties do you expect to face?

1. Grassroots coding organizations that focus on under-represented
   groups are typically shoestring operations.  We cannot rely on them
   to (for example) cover travel costs for people to attend workshops,
   or even to bring in an instructor.  We will therefore seek funding
   from other organizations to subsidize travel costs.  Software
   Carpentry has had good luck finding such money in the past for
   events such as its workshops for women in science and engineering,
   so I am confident we will be able to find at least part of what we
   need.

   Note: another solution would be to do some or all of the training
   online, but this provides many fewer opportunities for participants
   to make personal connections, which I believe will be crucial to
   the success of this project.

2. I am white, male, straight, and have no physical disabilities or
   criminal record.  In short, I'm about as privileged as it gets.  In
   order for this project to succeed, I will have to avoid falling
   into the "talking without listening" trap described earlier, and
   recruit a diverse group of collaborators.  I hope I can do the
   former, and I believe I can rely on contacts made through the T3
   summit, Software Carpentry, and other groups to achieve the latter.

6) What part does openness play in your idea?

"Open" is meaningless if people do not have the skills and
opportunities to take advantage of what is theoretically available to
them.  Making grassroots coding groups more effective will enable them
to bring "open" within reach of more people, particularly those who
are now notably absent from Silicon Valley.

7) Does your idea/project have a name?
[x] Yes
[ ] No

Teaching Tech Together (the name of the 2015 summit)

8) Have you started implementation of the idea?
[x] Yes
[ ] No

Work to date includes creation of Software Carpentry's instructor
training course, the original T3 summit, and *lots* of practice
organizing and running workshops.

9) How have you funded your initiative in the past?
[ ] Self funded
[ ] Family and friends
[ ] Not funded yet
[ ] Angel investor
[ ] Venture capital
[x] Other

A mix of grants, donations, and partnership fees from various research organizations.

10) Who are your current or potential key partners?

I will approach the organizations that have funded diversity
initiatives I've been involved in previously, including Microsoft,
GitHub, Rackspace, JP Morgan, Google, Rackspace, and the Python
Software Foundation.  I will also approach groups such as the
Highlander Research and Education Center, the Midwest Academy, and
others will proven track records of teaching commmunitiy organization
skills.

11) Do you intend to implement the idea as a for profit or not for profit initiative?
[ ] For profit
[x] Not for profit
[ ] Haven't thought about it...

12) Where will you be based during the fellowship?
Base Country: Canada
Base City: Toronto

13) Where will you implement your idea?
[ ] Same as above
[x] Online
[ ] Other country or city

14) Do you have an online presence?
[x] Yes
[ ] No

15) Does the idea/project have an online presence?
[x] Yes
[ ] No
