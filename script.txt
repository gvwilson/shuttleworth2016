Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Proposal October 2016
========================================================

Hi.  I'm Greg Wilson.  I'm a big fan of open source, open science, and
open data, but I think that calling something "open" is meaningless if
people don't have the skills they need to take advantage of it.  Right
now, one of the most important of those skills is programming, but the
computing industry is heavily biased toward a few kinds of people at
the expense of many others.  Lots of grassroots get-into-coding
organizations are trying to do something about that, and I'd like you
to help me help them.

Eighteen years ago, I started teaching scientists how to use computers
to get more done in less time and with less pain.  That has grown into
a non-profit organization called Software Carpentry that teaches
several hundred two-day coding workshops each year to tens of
thousands of people worldwide.

As Software Carpentry has grown, my personal focus has shifted from
teaching programming to teach people how to teach programming.  With
help from a lot of people, I've built an intensive two-day course on
modern evidence-based teaching methods, and have used it to train
hundreds of instructors.

I've learned a few things along the way.  The first is that if you
want to create a successful grassroots learn-to-code group, you need
more than just technical knowledge: you need to know how to teach and
how to organize a community.  Ironically, programmers - like me - set
up groups like Software Carpentry so that people won't have to figure
out coding on their own, but then assume that all the "soft" skills
are easy, and that we can pick them up or reinvent them without help
or guidance.

The second thing I've learned is that most people don't realize how
much specialists know about education and community organization.
Peer instruction, collaborative note-taking, interleaved practice: all
of these techniques help people learn better and faster, but most of
of the general public have never heard of them.

Similarly, thousands of community organizations have decades of
experience getting people to work together to make society a better
place.  Whether it's drawing up a budget, running a meeting, or
figuring out what to do about child care so that people can actually
come out to events, there's a thousand and one things that coders
don't need to reinvent, and a thousand and one mistakes they don't
need to make.

Last year, I helped organize a summit meeting of people who are
running grassroots get-into-coding efforts for groups that are
noticeably absent from Silicon Valley: women, people of color, people
of various sexual orientations, the disabled, the economically
disadvantaged - basically, everyone who isn't a straight, white or
Asian, middle class male.  A lot of the participants in that meeting,
and a lot of the volunteers who work with them, would like the kind of
training that I've been offering through Software Carpentry.

At the same time, many of them have important lessons to teach to
people like me: how to be a good ally, how to wrangle a meeting with
City Hall, or how to listen to a community to find out what they
actually need and how to help them get it.

I would therefore like to take what I've learned over the last few
years and use it to help grassroots learn-to-code groups.  I'll start
by teaching what I know about teaching: it's what I have to offer, and
it will get people into the room so that I can listen to them to find
out what they know about running groups like this.  I will fold what I
learn into what I teach so that it can be passed on, and recruit more
trainers in the same way that Software Carpentry does.  This will let
us reach more people, but will also ensure that what we say is shaped
by many voices and perspectives.  Everything at every stage will be
freely available under an open license, and we will show people how to
contribute so that the training materials will become a true community
resource.

A lot of open source projects are started by people filling their own
needs and then discovering that other people have the same ones.  This
project is meant to fill a need I didn't even know I had when I
started Software Carpentry eighteen years ago.  I think it will help
people who are trying to make computing and openness more inclusive be
more effective.  I *hope* that doing this will make the world a
slightly better place.

Thank you for listening - I look forward to hearing from you.
