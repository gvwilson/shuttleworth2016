Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Proposal October 2016
========================================================

Hi.  I'm Greg Wilson.  I'm a big fan of open source, open science, and
open data, but I think that calling something "open" is meaningless if
people don't have the skills they need to take advantage of it.  Right
now, one of the most important of those skills is programming, but the
computing industry is heavily biased toward a few kinds of people at
the expense of many others.  Lots of grassroots get-into-coding
organizations are trying to do something about that, and I'd like you
to help me help them.

Eighteen years ago, I started teaching scientists how to use computers
to get more done in less time and with less pain.  That has grown into
a non-profit organization called Software Carpentry that teaches
several hundred two-day coding workshops each year to tens of
thousands of people worldwide.

As Software Carpentry has grown, my personal focus has shifted from
teaching programming to teach people how to teach programming.  With
help from a lot of people, I've built an intensive two-day course on
modern evidence-based teaching methods, and have used it to train
hundreds of instructors.

I've learned a few things along the way.  The first is that if you
want to create a successful grassroots learn-to-code group, you need
more than just technical knowledge: you need to know how to teach and
how to organize a community.  Ironically, programmers - like me - set
up groups like Software Carpentry so that people won't have to figure
out coding on their own, but then assume that all the "soft" skills
are easy, and that we can pick them up or reinvent them without help
or guidance.

The second thing I've learned is that most people don't realize how
much specialists know about education and community organization.
Peer instruction, collaborative note-taking, interleaved practice: all
of these techniques help people learn better and faster, but most of
of the general public have never heard of them.

Similarly, thousands of community organizations have decades of
experience getting people to work together to make society a better
place.  Whether it's drawing up a budget, running a meeting, or
figuring out what to do about child care so that people can actually
come out to events, there's a thousand and one things that coders
don't need to reinvent, and a thousand and one mistakes they don't
need to make.

Last year, I helped organize a summit meeting of people who are
running grassroots get-into-coding efforts for groups that are
noticeably absent from Silicon Valley: women, people of color, people
of various sexual orientations, the disabled, the economically
disadvantaged - basically, everyone who isn't a straight, white or
Asian, middle class male.  A lot of the participants in that meeting,
and a lot of the volunteers who work with them, would like the kind of
training that I've been offering through Software Carpentry.

At the same time, many of them have important lessons to teach people
like me: how to be a good ally, how to wrangle a meeting with City
Hall, how to listen to a community to find out what they actually need
and how to help them get it...  I know more about this than I used to,
but I still have a lot to learn, and so do people with backgrounds
like mine who want to make a difference but are only just beginning to
realize that there's more to this than Javascript.

So here's my plan.  First, I'm going to offer classes on modern
evidence-based teaching methods to people involved in grassroots
learn-to-code groups.  That will help them right away, but it will
also get them into the room so that I can find out what they know that
other people don't.  Through interviews, observation, and helping them
out, I'll identify common practices, common problems, and common
solutions, then turn what I find into new lessons so that it can be
passed on.

Second, I recruit trainers from the people who've taken part in these
workshops using the same model that has worked so well for Software
Carpentry.  This will let us reach more people, but will also ensure
that what we say is shaped by many voices and perspectives.
Everything at every stage will be freely available under an open
license, and we will show people how to contribute so that the
training materials will be a true community resource.

I think this project will help people who are trying to make computing
more inclusive and openness more accessible.  I believe it will work
because it has once already, and I *hope* that it will make the world
a slightly better place.

Thank you for listening - I look forward to hearing from you.
